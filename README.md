# Data-Analysis
Performing data analysis on public dataset of Titanic. 
In this analysis, I have visualised and answered some questions regarding the People who were on board during the titanic
event.
The analysis is done, using various factors such as age, gender, class(in which they were travelling such that 1,2,3). 
looking on to the analysis, We see that class 1 people and women and children in general were the most number of people who 
were saved. While, People between age 25 - 40 especially male were the ones who lost the battle.
